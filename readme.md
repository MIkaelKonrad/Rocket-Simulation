## Description

Many rockets ascend to low earth orbit by use of multiple stages. This allows to get rid excess weight of the fuel tanks.

However each stage comes with a base weight consiting of the rocket engine, fuel pumps and other structural parts.

Thus a reduction of this base weight, should in theory increase the optimal number of stages for a rocket.

A reduction of this base could be achieved by adding stages on top of the rocket instead of on the bottom and thus eliminating the need for the rocket engine and fuel pumps in each stage.

The Goal of this project is to create a simulation of how certain staging configurations affect the efficiency of a Rocket. And thus also to check the feasibilty of a rocket as described above.
